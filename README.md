# Job Application Tracker

## <a href="https://jobs-app-tracker.herokuapp.com/">Link to app</a>

## Minimum Viable Product
<p>Users can submit their job applications & segment them by the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applied, but no response</li>
  <li>Upcoming interview</li>
  <li>Completed interview</li>
  <li>Received job offer</li>
</ul>
<p>The home page will display a sign-up/login form & links to various job boards. After logging in, the home page will also display all job applications for that user.</p>
<p>The navigation bar will include buttons that segment the user's applications.</p>

### Pop-Up Modal
<p>Users can click an application to view all it's details. Before clicking the application will be an overview that only shows key information.</p>

## Collaboration Notes
<p>In the planning stages it would have prevented multiple issues by discussing variable names & consistently using the same variable names across developers. The Trello board was extremely benficial for breaking down allocation & assigning of tasks. Clear & regular communication across developers decreased downtime caused by bugs. We had some issues with GitHub so commiting to GitHub more frequently would decrease downtime.</p>
